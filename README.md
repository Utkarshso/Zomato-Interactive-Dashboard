## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps Zomato understand their business better. It helps to understand customer preferences, restaurant performance, and overall trends. Through different visualizations, key areas for improvement can be identified. This dashboard can help analyze delivery times, order frequency, and customer satisfaction, allowing Zomato to optimize its services.



### Steps followed

- Step 1: Load data into Power BI Desktop, using relevant datasets (e.g., restaurant details, order information, customer reviews).
- Step 2: Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3: Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4: Address any data quality issues, such as missing values or inconsistencies.
- Step 5: Transform and clean the data as needed, creating calculated columns or measures for relevant metrics.

    - Total Orders
    - Average Order Value
    - Customer Satisfaction Ratings
    - Top Restaurants by Orders
    - Order Distribution by Time of Day
    - Delivery Time Analysis
    - City-wise Order Analysis
- Step 8: Add slicers for filtering data by relevant dimensions (e.g., date range, city, restaurant type).
- Step 9: Use card visuals to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Step 10: Incorporate interactive elements, such as drill-throughs or tooltips, to enhance user experience.
- Step 11: Add text boxes for titles, descriptions, and insights.
- Step 12: Include Zomato's logo and branding elements.
